Description: This is an R package as the next generation of
    GGobi, a software package for interactive and dynamic
    statistical graphics. It includes most of features in
    GGobi such as brushing, zooming, panning, identifying
    and linking, as well as common types of statistical
    graphics, e.g. bar plot, scatter plot, boxplot,
    histogram, density plot, spine plot, parallel
    coordinates plot, mosaic plot, maps, missing value
    plot, time series plot, tour, scatter plot matrix,
    hexagons and tiles (color images), etc. Based on the
    support of several other packages, cranvas aims for
    speed (from Qt) and flexibility (from R), with the
    style and design borrowed from ggplot2.
